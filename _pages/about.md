Hi, I'm Augusto, but most of my friends call me Guga!

Nowadays, I work as a Data Scientist, but I had experience on some other stages of the data pipeline like Data Viz and ETL. Moreover, I am currently doing the Databricks bootcamp in Data Engineering.

I’m a Chemical Engineer that have always been passionate about computer science and programming, working on many different domains, from thermodynamic modeling to crop forecast.

I’ve spent the last years working on the National Brazilian Institute of Statistics, mostly developing machine learning pipelines to different areas of agriculture using structured data like weather and temperature registers or non structured data like satellite imagery.

During my career, besides data science skills, I had the chance to develop solid software engineering skills and learned good development practices. 

I came from Salvador ,one of the most amazing cities in the world. I am enthusiastic about sports, traveling and cooking, especially when my friends are around. 

You can check my CV here or contact me on LinkedIn(https://www.linkedin.com/in/augustosbarreto/).
