This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), An easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.

Hi, I'm Augusto, but most of my friends call me Guga. I'm from [Salvador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador,_Bahia), one of the most amazing cities in the world. I am enthusiastic on sports, traveling and cooking, especially when my friends are around.

I made this blog to share a little bit of my experiences and my projects involving computer science, most on the data pipeline, where I had most of my working experience.
