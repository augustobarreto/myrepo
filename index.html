Hi, I'm Augusto, but most of my friends call me Guga. I'm from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador,_Bahia">Salvador</a> ,one of the most amazing cities in the world. I am enthusiastic on sports, traveling and cooking, especially when my friends are around.

<p style="font-size:160%;">  
I made this blog to share a little bit of my experiences and my projects involving computer science, most on the data pipeline process, where I had most of my working experience.
